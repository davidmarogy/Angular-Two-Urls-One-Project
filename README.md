# Angular Two URLs One Project

This project will show how to run a project with two different base URLs. For further information you can visit the
ITELL Blog.

## Run the local server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
In a terminal run `ng serve` for the local server. This makes it possible to reach the customer URL at `http://localhost:4200`.
next run in a new terminal `ng serve --port 4210`, now you can reach the retailer URL at `http://localhost:4210`.
